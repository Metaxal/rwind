                                ==== RWind ====
 
                           The Racket Window Manager

An extensible window manager aiming to be similar to Sawfish 
(http://sawfish.wikia.com), but written in the Racket programming language 
(http://www.racket-lang.org).

Warnings: 
- This package is under current development and is in no way stable, and
is intended for testing purposes only. 
- No backward compatibility will be ensured in th 0.x branch
- Due to a security issue, the current version should not be used on multiple user computers. Use at your own risk!

Current features:
-----------------
  - very little
  - a client command line
  - customization of key bindings and mouse bindings
  - workspaces
  - no frames (yet)

Installation:
-------------
1) Install Racket: http://www.racket-lang.org

2) Create a directory where to place Racket projects (e.g., 
/home/me/Programming/Racket), then do, in this directory:

  git clone http://github.com/kazzmir/x11-racket.git
  git clone http://github.com/Metaxal/RWind.git
  raco link --name rwind RWind
  raco link x11-racket
  raco setup x11-racket rwind

3) Copy the provided .xinitrc-rwind file in your home directory, and modify its
contents according to your installation.

4) Optional, but recommended:

Copy (or link) and rename one of the files in the user-script-examples directory
to $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rwind/config.rkt (or to $HOME/.config/rwind/config.rkt if
the xdg environment variable is not set).

Take a look at the file to know what key and mouse bindings are defined. You can
modify it as you want.

The file simple.rkt defines a number of default key and mouse bindings.
 - Control-left-button to move a window around
 - Control-right-button to resize the window
 - Control-Alt-t to open xterm
 - Alt-F12 opens the client 

5a) In a login shell, type the following:

  xinit .xinitrc-rwind -- :1 &

You may need to modify the display ":1" to ":2" for example if ":1" is not 
available.

Press Alt-Escape to quit the session.

5b) You can also test with Xephyr (from the xserver-xephyr package), that 
creates a nested X session (thanks to Asumu):
 
  Xephyr -ac -noreset -screen 800x600 :1 &
  DISPLAY=:1.0 racket rwind.rkt &



Installation for use in lightdm/gdm:
------------------------------------

Do steps 1-4) of the installation above.

1) In rwind directory, compile and install the executable with:

  raco exe rwind.rkt && sudo cp rwind /usr/bin

2) Copy the provided file rwind.desktop to /usr/share/xsessions/rwind.desktop

3) Close your session, choose RWind in the session menu and open your session.

The client:
-----------

The client is a console where you can evaluate expressions. 
In RWind's directory, it can be opened in a terminal with:

  racket client.rkt

Try for example:
> (map window-name (window-list))

The list of available symbols provided by RWind is given by:
> (known-identifiers)

All bindings of '#lang racket' are available too.

You can get help on a known identifier with:
> (describe 'window-list)
